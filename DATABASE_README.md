# Firestore Database Structure for Large-Scale User Management

This repository contains the implementation of a Firestore database structure designed for large-scale user management, with a focus on having everything saved in one place for each individual user while maintaining scalability and performance.

## Overview

The database structure is organized around separate collections for different user types, with subcollections for user-specific data and specialized collections for discovery features. This approach balances the requirement to have everything in one place for each user with the need for scalability in a large-scale application.

## Documentation

- [**DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md**](./DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md): Comprehensive documentation of the database structure
- [**FIRESTORE_STRUCTURE_BENEFITS.md**](./FIRESTORE_STRUCTURE_BENEFITS.md): Explanation of the benefits of this structure for large-scale user management
- [**DATABASE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md**](./DATABASE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md): Current status of the database migration
- [**DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**](./DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md): Summary of the implementation and next steps

## Scripts

- [**migrateToNewStructure.js**](./scripts/migrateToNewStructure.js): Script to migrate data from the legacy structure to the new structure
- [**verifyDatabaseStructure.js**](./scripts/verifyDatabaseStructure.js): Script to verify that the database structure is correctly set up
- [**addSampleData.js**](./scripts/addSampleData.js): Script to add sample data to the database
- [**addLicenseData.js**](./scripts/addLicenseData.js): Script to add sample license data to professionals

## Cloud Functions

- [**dbStructure.ts**](./functions/src/dbStructure.ts): Cloud Functions to maintain the database structure

## Implementation Status

The database structure has been successfully implemented with:

- ✅ Role-specific collections (`users`, `professionals`, `clients`, `admins`)
- ✅ Professional subcollections (`portfolio`, `services`, `timeOff`, `workingHours`, `licenses`)
- ✅ Discovery collections (`content`, `theLooks`, `geoIndex`)
- ✅ Sample data added to all collections

## Key Features

1. **Role-Specific Collections**: Separate collections for different user types
2. **Subcollections for User-Specific Data**: All data related to a user is hierarchically organized
3. **Specialized Collections for Discovery**: Efficient implementation of discovery features
4. **Cloud Functions for Maintenance**: Automatic synchronization between collections

## Usage

### Migration

To migrate data from the legacy structure to the new structure:

```bash
node scripts/migrateToNewStructure.js
```

### Verification

To verify that the database structure is correctly set up:

```bash
node scripts/verifyDatabaseStructure.js
```

### Adding Sample Data

To add sample data to the database:

```bash
node scripts/addSampleData.js
```

To add sample license data to professionals:

```bash
node scripts/addLicenseData.js
```

### Deploying Cloud Functions

To deploy the Cloud Functions that maintain the database structure:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy Cloud Functions to maintain the structure
2. Create remaining collections as users interact with the application
3. Monitor performance as the user base grows
4. Implement backup strategy

## Conclusion

The implemented database structure successfully balances the requirement to have everything in one place for each user with the need for scalability in a large-scale application. The role-specific collections with subcollections provide a logical organization of user data, and the specialized collections enable efficient implementation of discovery features.
